# crud-react-demo

To Run this project you will need:

1. run the server in the frontend folder as stated here
https://github.com/mroyal/frontend

2. run this project in a different port of your local host
npm install
npm run start

Things I would have liked to add to this project.
- Images to the templates: some styles and images would make the templates look better
- a WYSIWYG editor for the template builder would come handy 
- Tests: Jasmine Tests to check if the response is coming back correctly, and if we are displaying the right info 

Notes:
I had to standarize the response on the json file to have the templates be more like the file included in 
mock-response folder

Thank you
